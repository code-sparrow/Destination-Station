## Destination Station (project-2)

NYC Citi Bike and Yelp Querying App

![TitleSlide](static/images/Title_Slide.PNG)

# Topic
We would like to explore the city bike sharing system of New York City and popular trip destinations from particular stations. First, weâ€™d like to map out the total amount of bike stations in an area, the subway stations, and the subway lines. App users can click on a bike-station nearby to start from, and the app will highlight the 10 most popular destinations based on the "Citi Bike Trip Histories" data set. App users can click on any destination-station, to investigate why it is popular, and get a list of restaurants and other attractions in the area; encouraging users to rent a bike and make a trip.
